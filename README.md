# Testing-python---FMOD

Just followed the instructions here
http://www.fmod.org/questions/question/how-to-use-fmod-from-a-python-script/

Added some code.
Hope i didnt breach any copyright.
Most files used are downloaded free from
http://www.fmod.org/

I used python3.5 for this.

So for testing vispy and camera, you need vispy module, and opencv module.
Easy to install with pip. :)
